# BuffAlert
The addon is able to play a sound when you gain a specific buff.   
Currently the addon only checks for Windfury but can be modified for other spells by editing the .lua file and adding an entry for the relevant spell message.    
Note that when using an unmodified client, the ability to play a sound may be limited by the default sound channel limit such as in raids etc.
